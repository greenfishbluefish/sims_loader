            * Unsupported by Sims
[ ] Write documentation
    * This is done via direct edit on DockerHub.
    * Can we automate this like github.com/docker-library/docs?
[ ] Write a test that demonstrates a multi-column relationship
[ ] Write a test that demonstrates a M2M relationship
    [ ] ... with the PK on the FKs and an extra value on the crosstable.
    [ ] ... with the PK on the FKs + the extra value
[ ] toposort file passed to $opts->{toposort}
    [ ] Break self-relationship
    [ ] Break A-B-A relationship at A-B

[-] Build Dockerfiles to install DBDs (all downloaded)
    [X] MySQL
    [ ] MariaDB (same as mysql?)
    [ ] PostgreSQL
    [ ] Oracle
    [ ] SQL*Server (devel/vagrant_sql_server_express)
    [ ] Sybase (same as SQL*Server?)
    [ ] Others?
[ ] Test with database-specific column types
    [ ] Postgres JSON
[ ] constraints file passed to $opts->{constraints}
[ ] All parameters should be settable by ENVVAR
    * SIMS_LOADER_XYZ
    * --base-directory works like this, but by hand
[ ] Handle views
[ ] Stop running within the container as root for development
    * All the cpanfile work is owned by root
[ ] Change volume mapping to map `-v /:/data`
    * Modify absolute paths in the host-side command to prepend "/data"?
[ ] "validate" will:
    [ ] Ensure all provided files work
    [ ] Connect to the database and read the DDL
    [ ] Validate the model file works with the DBIC::SL-generated model
    [ ] Validate the constraints works with the model
    [ ] Validate the specification works with the model

-------- COMPLETED --------

[X] Add a --base-directory for all the files
    * Used within the container to do "SIMS_LOADER_DIRECTORY_PREFIX=/data"
[X] "drivers" to list installed DBD modules
    [X] Test with more than just SQLite
        * Requires the test suite to function with multiple Docker containers
[X] Get load working with sqlite
    [X] Cannot run two test_app() in the same process
[X] "model" to list the generated model sims_loader is working with
    [X] Lists "<model>: <table>" in alphabetical order
    [X] "model <model>" to list the detail for that model
[X] Write tests for multiple tables
    [X] Refactor the tests to create databases from code without SQL
[X] Fix auto-generation of values with NOT NULL (Issue with test process)
    * This works by hand with Sims 0.300402
[X] Throw an error when the schema is empty or unset.
[X] Validate that a command was passed, otherwise default to "help"
[X] model file modifying DBIC::SL
    [X] Validate all sources exist by model name
        * Will not support model by table name
