[X] Add a --base-directory for all the files
    * Used within the container to do "SIMS_LOADER_DIRECTORY_PREFIX=/data"
[X] "drivers" to list installed DBD modules
    [X] Test with more than just SQLite
        * Requires the test suite to function with multiple Docker containers
[X] Get load working with sqlite
1)  [ ] Test auto-generation of values with NOT NULL
    [X] Cannot run two test_app() in the same process
[ ] Throw an error when the schema is empty or unset.
[-] "model" to list the generated model sims_loader is working with
    [-] Lists "<model>: <table>" in alphabetical order
    [ ] "model <model>" to list the detail for that model
[ ] "validate" will:
    [ ] Ensure all provided files work
    [ ] Connect to the database and read the DDL
    [ ] Validate the model file works with the DBIC::SL-generated model
    [ ] Validate the constraints works with the model
    [ ] Validate the specification works with the model
[-] Build Dockerfiles to install DBDs (all downloaded)
    [-] MySQL
    [ ] MariaDB (same as mysql?)
    [ ] PostgreSQL
    [ ] Oracle
    [ ] SQL*Server (devel/vagrant_sql_server_express)
    [ ] Sybase (same as SQL*Server?)
    [ ] Others?
    [ ] Validate that a command was passed, otherwise default to "help"
[ ] constraints file passed to $opts->{constraints}
[ ] model file modifying DBIC::SL
[ ] toposort file passed to $opts->{toposort}
[ ] Write documentation
[ ] All parameters should be settable by ENVVAR
    * SIMS_LOADER_XYZ
    * --base-directory works like this, but by hand
[ ] Test with dates (may need auto-inflation)
[ ] Test with sim types (phone-number, zipcode, etc)
[ ] Stop running within the container as root
    * All the cpanfile work is owned by root
