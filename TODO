[-] Manage the seed
    [X] Return the seed
    [X] Accept the seed
    [ ] Test reuse of the seed (Blocked on retrieving values from fork_subtest)
        * https://gist.github.com/exodist/42732aa8e63c492d9d20ca1465d84880
[ ] Make Oracle11 run under 4 seconds like all other drivers
    * Root cause is $self->dbh->foreign_key_info() takes 7-8 seconds per table
        * Called from ::DBI->_table_fk_info(), called from:
            * ::Base->_setup_src_meta()
            * ::Base->_load_relationships() (could be cached?)
    * Is still ~4 seconds even with "_disable_fk_detection => 1"
[ ] Add support for oracle12 and oracle10 in addition to oracle11
[ ] Improve launch script to detect loopback and substitute a better address
[ ] Convert base image from ubuntu-xenial to alpine
    * https://github.com/gliderlabs/docker-alpine/issues/11
[ ] Determine why lack of network causes a 10+ second delay in execution
[ ] model file modifying DBIC::SL
    [ ] Relationships (has_many / belongs_to)
        [ ] Validate the same number of columns provided
        [ ] Add a multi-column relationship
    [ ] Column nullchance
        [ ] Set a nullable column to nullchance
        [ ] Throw an error when setting a not-null column with a nullchance
    [ ] constraints file
        [ ] child requirements
    [ ] "ignore" for toposort->skip
        [ ] Break A-B-A relationship at A-B
        [ ] Break A-B-A relationship at B-A
[ ] Throw an error when the schema is not found
[ ] Throw an error when the table is not found for `model --name`
[ ] Improve error messages for model validation failures
[ ] Write a test that demonstrates a multi-column relationship
[ ] Write a test that demonstrates a multi-column primary key
[ ] Write a test that demonstrates a self-referential relationship
[ ] Write a test that demonstrates a M2M relationship
    [ ] ... with the PK on the FKs and an extra value on the crosstable.
    [ ] ... with the PK on the FKs + the extra value
[ ] Test with dates (may need auto-inflation)
[ ] Add support for these databases in the docker-compose.yml
    [ ] Sybase (same as SQL*Server?)
    [/] SQL*Server (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-setup-docker)
        * http://www.freetds.org/userguide/choosingtdsprotocol.htm
    [ ] MariaDB (same as mysql?)
[ ] Test with database-specific column types
    [ ] Postgres JSON
[ ] All parameters should be settable by ENVVAR
    * SIMS_LOADER_XYZ
    * --base-directory works like this, but by hand
[ ] Handle views
[ ] Stop running within the container as root for development
    * All the cpanfile work is owned by root
[ ] Change volume mapping to map `-v /:/data`
    * Modify absolute paths in the host-side command to prepend "/data"?
[ ] "validate" will:
    [ ] Ensure all provided files work
    [ ] Connect to the database and read the DDL
    [ ] Validate the model file (if any) works with the DBIC::SL model
    [ ] Validate the constraints (if any) works with the DBIC::SL model
    [ ] Validate the specification (if any) works with the DBIC::SL model
[ ] Automate updating of documentation from README.md
    * This is done via direct edit on DockerHub.
    * Can we automate this like github.com/docker-library/docs?
